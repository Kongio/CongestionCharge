# CongestionCharge

Glasgow has implemented an hourly congestion charge for cars and larger vehicles on weekdays. The charge is set at £2 per hour between 7am and 12pm, and £2.50 per hour between 12pm and 7pm. Between 7pm and 7am travel is free. Travel at the weekend is always free. Motorbikes are charged a flat rate of £1 per hour, and share the same free travel periods as cars. The charge per period is rounded down to the nearest 10p for parts of hours.
